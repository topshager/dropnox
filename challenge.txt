Step 2
In this step your goal is to allow a logged-in (authenticated) user to be able to see the folder structure for their virtual drive.

You should allow them to create one or more folders at the top level. Each folder should be able to contain one of more folders. If you want some inspiration for what this looks like you could sign up to Dropbox or Google Drive and try them out.

Step 3
In this step your goal is to upload one or more files (or folders and their contents) to a folder via the UI (or API).

Step 4
In this step your goal is to allow the user to create sharable links to a file or folder in their drive.

They should be able to create a link that only they can access or a link that is public (accessible without authentication).

Step 5
In this step your goal is to write a tool to sync a local folder on their local machine with their online account.

Initially you might want to make it a CLI program, but eventually you could turn it into a background service that runs on startup. Either option should have some configuration that allows you to specify which local folder is the root.

It should poll the remote ‘drive’ at a set frequency and either upload a new local file (or new changes to an existing one) or download remote files that are newer / have changed more recently than local files.
